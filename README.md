# LeetCode Solutions  
*A repository of my daily programming practice tackling LeetCode problems in C++*  
— by Mayank Kumar (01mayankk)

## 📘 About  
This repository contains my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/01mayank/).  
Each directory is named according to the problem number and title (e.g., `0001-two-sum`, `0014-longest-common-prefix`, etc.).  
All code is written in C++ and submitted regularly as part of my daily coding routine.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals  
- **Track progress**: Maintain a structured log of solved problems with increasing difficulty.  
- **Showcase skills**: Demonstrate proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving (valuable for interviews).  
- **Build habit**: Practice consistently and cover a broad range of problem types (arrays, strings, graphs, trees, DP, etc.).  
- **Provide reference**: Use my solutions as a personal study tool and potentially assist peers who are learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
```
Leetcode-solutions/
├── 0001-two-sum/
│ ├── two_sum.cpp
│ └── README.md ← optional notes for that problem
├── 0003-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
│ ├── solution.cpp
│ └── ...
├── 0014-longest-common-prefix/
│ ├── longest_common_prefix.cpp
│ └── ...

└── README.md ← this file
```


- **Folder naming convention**: `XXXX-problem-title` where `XXXX` is the zero-padded LeetCode problem number.  
- **Files inside**: Each solution folder contains C++ source code (`.cpp`) and optionally notes or comments in a `README.md`.

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. **Browse by number**: Navigate folders by problem number to find the solution you’re interested in.  
2. **View code**: Open the `.cpp` file to review approach, logic, and comments.  
3. **Run locally**: Copy the code to your environment (Visual Studio, CLion, g++, etc.) and test with custom input or test cases.  
4. **Study & compare**: Use as a reference – compare your own implementation, learn new patterns, and improve.

---

## 💡 Highlights  
- Solutions span from **easy** to **hard** problems, covering a wide array of themes (sliding window, hash tables, recursion, graphs, dynamic programming).  
- Each problem is solved in **C++**, showcasing handle over language features (STL, pointers, smart memory, high-performance code).  
- A consistent naming pattern and organized folder structure make it easy to navigate and scale.

## 📝 Notes & Tips  
- Although I include comments in my code, I encourage you to add **your own comments** or experiment further (e.g., alternative algorithms, time/space optimizations).  
- Use this as **study material**, *not* as a substitute for solving the problems yourself — the real learning happens when you attempt the problem first.  
- Feel free to **fork** or **clone** the repository if you’d like to explore the solutions — and consider adding your own improvements or variants.

---

## 👥 Contributions & Feedback  
- This repo is primarily **for my personal study**, but if you spot errors, would like to discuss a solution, or want to suggest improvements, feel free to reach out via GitHub.  
- If you’d like to submit enhancements (e.g., additional comments, alternative solutions), you are welcome to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
