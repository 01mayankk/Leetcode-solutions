class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if a number is a power of two
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // Check if n is greater than 0 and if it has only one bit set
        return n > 0 && !(n & (n - 1));
        // Explanation:
        // - n > 0 ensures that n is a positive number.
        // - (n & (n - 1)) checks if n has only one bit set in its binary representation.
        //   If n is a power of two, it will have exactly one bit set (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
        //   The expression (n & (n - 1)) will be 0 if n is a power of two.
        //   Therefore, if both conditions are true, n is a power of two.
